This video demonstrates a prototype of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates Thai Sign Language (TSL) content for educational purposes.

The system retrieves Thai sign language terms and related explanations from a local knowledge base and uses AI to generate natural-language responses that reference those signs.

All data, images, and video snippets are used strictly for research and educational purposes, to explore how multimodal AI can support accessibility and language learning for the Deaf community in Thailand.

© The Thai Sign Language content belongs to the National Association of the Deaf in Thailand (NADT) and is credited accordingly.
